# ELAN_Segmenter

## This tool is used to segment EAF files into set time slots for transcription. This feature does not currently exist in ELAN and seems to be a useful feature. 

## Python script takes two arguments, the EAF file, and the desired time segment size (i.e. every 30 secs, 15 sec, 10 secs, etc,). 

## Segmentation starts at the beginning, any leftover time will be left as a smaller segment at the end of the file.
